        If you do not have MythTV front end(s) separate from your MythTV backend then leave this option
        set to "true".
        Indicates whether the MNV grabbers are run on a MythTV FE or from a Web server
        The default is grabbers run locally on the FE
        'true'  run on the local FE
        'false' run from a Web sever whose URL is derived from the URL elements (ip_hostname and port)

    <local>true</local>

    <!--
        Information used to build a URL to call the MNV grabbers that run on a Web server
        Most frequently the Web server is the same server where MythWeb is installed
        The value of this option is to have one central place where the MNV grabbers are run which is only
        relevant when one or more FE's are on separate computers.
        These values are only used if the "local" element is set to "false"
        "ip_hostname"    The IP address or hostname of the Web server where the MNV grabbers were installed
        "port"           The port of the MNV grabber Web server CGI application
        The ip_hostname and port values here are just examples and need to be changed to your specific
        set up.
