<userComedyCentral>
<!--
    This is the Comedy Central user preference file. This is the place to enable or disable the
    source URLs which will make up the videos added to a MythNetvision treeview. Within each
    subDirectory are one or more source URLs that are used to get the videos and meta data
    information.
    The only attribute that a user should ever change would be to enable "true" or disable "false" a
    specific "sourceURL".
    These user files are maintained automatically with a user's preferences preserved. This means
    that when an updated Mashup file is distributed with MythNetvision then the user's preference file
    will be updated accordingly. New source URLs can be added and others removed. Any new URLs will
    automatically have at least one per "subDirectory" enabled so the user will be alerted to the new
    source the next time they update their treeview maps.

<!--
    The Comedy Central RSS feed URLs.
    "globalmax" (optional) Is a way to limit the number of items processed per source for all
                treeview URLs. A value of zero (0) means there are no limitations.
    "max" (optional) Is a way to limit the number of items processed for an individual sourceURL.
          This value will override any "globalmax" setting. A value of zero (0) means
          there are no limitations and would be the same if the attribute was no included at all.
    "enabled" If you want to remove a source URL then change the "enabled" attribute to "false".
    "xsltFile" The XSLT file name that is used to translate data into MNV item format
    "type" The source type "xml", "html" and "xhtml"
    "url" The link that is used to retrieve the information from the Internet
    "parameter" (optional) Specifies source specific parameter that are passed to the XSLT stylesheet.
                Multiple parameters require the use of key/value pairs. Example:
                parameter="key1:value1;key2:value2" with the ";" as the separator value.
