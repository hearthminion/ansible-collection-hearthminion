<!--
    This is the Mashup user preference file. This is the place to enable or disable the
    source URLs which will make up the videos added to a MythNetvision treeview. Within each
    subDirectory are one or more source URLs that are used to get the videos and meta data
    information.
    The only attribute that a user should ever change would be to enable "true" or disable "false" a
    specific "sourceURL".
    These user files are maintained automatically with a user's preferences preserved. This means
    that when an updated Mashup file is distributed with MythNetvision then the user's preference file
    will be updated accordingly. New source URLs can be added and others removed. Any new URLs will
    automatically have at least one per "subDirectory" enabled so the user will be alerted to the new
    source the next time they update their treeview maps.

          This value will override any "globalmax" setting. A value of zero (0) means
