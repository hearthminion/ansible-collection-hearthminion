<!--
    This is the TedTalks user preference file. This is the place to enable or disable the
    source URLs which will make up the videos added to a MythNetvision treeview. Within each
    subDirectory are one or more source URLs that are used to get the videos and meta data
    information.
    The only attributes that a user should ever change would be to enable "true" or disable "false" a
    specific "sourceURL" or change the Flash video quality by changeing the "parameter attribute".
    These user files are maintained automatically with a user's preferences preserved. This means
    that when an updated the Tedtalks file is distributed with MythNetvision then the user's
    preference file will be updated accordingly. New source URLs can be added and others removed.
    Any new URLs will automatically have at least one per "subDirectory" enabled so the user will be
    alerted to the new source the next time they update their treeview maps.

    The TedTalks Search HTML URLs.
    "enabled" If you want to remove a source URL then change the "enabled" attribute to "false".
    "xsltFile" The XSLT file name that is used to translate data into MNV item format
    "type" The source type "xml", "html" and "xhtml"
    "url" The link that is used to retrieve the information from the Internet. If this value is empty
          then the url is specified in a configuration file that should not be altered by a user.
    "pageFunction" Identifies a XPath extension function that returns the start page/index for the
                    specific source.
    "mnvsearch" (optional) Identifies that search items are to include items from the MNV table using the
                mnvsearch_api.py functions. This attributes value must match the "feedtitle" value
                as it is in the "internetcontentarticles" table. When present the "xsltFile",
                "url" and "pageFunction" attributes are left empty as they will be ignored.
    "parameter" (optional) Specifies source specific parameter that are passed to the XSLT stylesheet.
                Multiple parameters require the use of key/value pairs. Example:
                parameter="key1=value1;key2=value2" with a "=" or ";" as the separator value.
                For this grabber the parameter specifies the quality of the Flash video played in
                the MythBrowser. Permisable values are "flv=high", "flv=medium" and "flv=low". If you
                experience excessive stuttering or tearing during MythBrowser Flash playback use a lower
                quality setting.

    The TedTalks RSS feed and HTML URLs.
    "globalmax" (optional) Is a way to limit the number of items processed per source for all
                treeview URLs. A value of zero (0) means there are no limitations.
    "max" (optional) Is a way to limit the number of items processed for an individual sourceURL.
          This value will override any "globalmax" setting. A value of zero (0) means
          there are no limitations and would be the same if the attribute was no included at all.
    "enabled" If you want to remove a source URL then change the "enabled" attribute to "false".
    "xsltFile" The XSLT file name that is used to translate data into MNV item format
