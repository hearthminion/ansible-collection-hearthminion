        This option specifies the Web page link that MythBrowser will display.
        "fullscreen" Displays the video MythBrowser full web page automatically.  This
                    is the default and will be used if no other format has been specified.
                    Of all the link types this one has the largest playback video display.
        "bbcweb"    Displays the web page that you would see if you surfed the BBC iPlayer web site.
        "bigscreen" Displays a web page that supports game consoles like the Wii and
                    PS3 called "bigscreen". Video window is smaller but screen is less cluttered then a Web
                    page and has larger buttons and controls which are a little more remote friendly.

        BBC Treeview video RSS feeds.
        "globalmax" (optional) Is a way to limit the number of items processed per RSS feed for all
                    treeview URLs. A value of zero (0) means there are no limitions.
        "max" (optional)  Is a way to limit the number of items processed for an individual RSS feed.
              This value will override any "globalmax" setting. A value of zero (0) means
              there are no limitions and would be the same if the attribute was no included at all.
        "enabled" If you want to remove a RSS feed then change the "enabled" attribute to "false". Do not
                  delete the element.
